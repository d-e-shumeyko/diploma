Diary of BioLabTech
[date]
I have recently been thinking of my youth & how we would play old games with my dad, before all this android nonsense
My favorite memory is when he showed me his favorite game Contra, how he beat it fairly, but for me (as I was very small) he would put in a cheat code.
I still remember the code: up, up, down, down, left, right,left, right, B, A, Start
